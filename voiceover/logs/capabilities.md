# Overview

> Everything Fish Audio can do, and how to build with it

Fish Audio is a voice AI platform. Every core feature is available three ways: in the [web app](/overview/platform) (no code), through the [REST API](/api-reference/introduction), and via the official [SDK](/developer-guide/sdk-guide/quickstart).

## Core features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text to Speech" icon="microphone" href="/features/text-to-speech">
    Convert text into lifelike speech with the `s2.1-pro`, `s2-pro`, and `s1` models.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Speech to Text" icon="waveform" href="/features/speech-to-text">
    Transcribe audio with optional timestamps. Use `transcribe-1-pro` for multi-speaker conversations and emotion cues.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Voice Cloning" icon="clone" href="/features/voice-cloning">
    Clone a voice instantly from a clip, or train a persistent model.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Realtime Streaming" icon="bolt" href="/features/realtime-streaming">
    Stream audio as it generates, for voice agents and live apps.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Manage Voices" icon="sliders" href="/features/manage-voices">
    List, inspect, update, and delete your voice models.
  </Card>

## Also in the web app

These run in the browser, no code required. See the [Platform guide](/overview/platform).

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Voice Changer" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/overview/platform">
    Transform existing audio into a different voice.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Story Studio" icon="book-open" href="/overview/platform">
    Produce multi-speaker, long-form audio: audiobooks and narration.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Music & Sound Effects" icon="music" href="/overview/platform">
    Generate music and cinematic sound effects from a prompt.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Audio Separation" icon="scissors" href="/overview/platform">
    Split audio into stems, and related processing utilities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Models

These text-to-speech models power most capabilities:

* **`s2.1-pro`**: the recommended production model, with improved quality, latency, and throughput over S2-Pro.
* **`s2.1-pro-free`**: the same model at \$0 for testing, prototyping, development, and smaller businesses, without TTFA or DPA guarantees.
* **`s2-pro`**: the previous-generation S2 model, with multi-speaker and natural-language expression control.
* **`s1`**: the previous generation, with `(parenthesis)` emotion tags.

For speech to text, use **`transcribe-1`** for general transcription or **`transcribe-1-pro`** for multi-speaker conversations and inline emotion cues. Select either model with the `model` header on `POST /v1/asr`.

See [Models Overview](/developer-guide/models-pricing/models-overview) and [Choosing a Model](/developer-guide/models-pricing/choosing-a-model) for the full lineup, languages, and limits.
